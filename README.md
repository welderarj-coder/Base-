Build TrustSplit: a Web3 "Splitwise." Groups deposit USDC into shared vaults on Base (Ethereum L2). While waiting to pay bills, funds earn yield via DeFi protocols like Aave. The Smart Contract automates payments and distributes profits among members. It’s transparent, low-cost, and puts idle cash to work.
